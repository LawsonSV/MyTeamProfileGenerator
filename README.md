# MyTeamProfileGenerator

## Description
In this project I had to write a series of prompts using inquirer, write functions to take those answers and make classes with them, and then write functions to print those answers 
onto an html document in order to a list of team members or "team profile".

Additionally, I had to write tests to prove that all of the class methods/functions in the libraries folder were functioning properly.
